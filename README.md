Hephy (pronounced HEF-ee) Workflow is an open source Platform as a Service (PaaS) that adds a
developer-friendly layer to any [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster, making it easy to
deploy and manage applications on your own servers.

For more information about the Hephy Workflow, please visit the main project page at
<https://github.com/teamhephy/workflow>.

We welcome your input! If you have feedback, please [submit an issue][issues]. If you'd like to participate in development, please read the "Development" section below and [submit a pull request][prs].

# About

`deisrel` is a utility tool for assisting with Hephy product releases. It makes is easy to check what components need to be released before making a workflow release.

# Installing deisrel

You can install the latest version of `deisrel` from the following links:

- [linux-amd64](https://storage.googleapis.com/deisrel/deisrel-latest-linux-amd64)
- [darwin-amd64](https://storage.googleapis.com/deisrel/deisrel-latest-darwin-amd64)

Alternatively, you can compile this project from source using Go 1.6+:

	$ git clone https://github.com/teamhephy/deisrel
	$ cd deisrel
	$ make bootstrap build
	$ ./deisrel

Once done, you can then move the client binary anywhere on your PATH:

	$ mv deisrel /usr/local/bin/

# Usage

deisrel requires two files, the `requirements.lock` file from a [Kubernetes Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) Workflow chart,
and a repository mapping file, allowing deisrel to map between a repository and chart name.

You may fetch the `requirements.lock` file from a given chart in the following manner:

	$ helm repo add hephy https://charts.teamhephy.com
	$ helm fetch --untar hephy/workflow --version v2.23.0
	$ cat workflow/requirements.lock


As the Workflow component list has stabilized, the repository mapping file (`map.json`) at the root of this project may be used.  (However, it will need to be updated when/if the list changes.)  The key is the repository name, and the value is the chart name, as found in the `requirements.lock` file.

With these two files, you can use deisrel to generate a report:

```console
$ deisrel path/to/requirements.lock path/to/repomapping.json

workflow-manager         v2.4.4 -> v2.4.5 (clean)
```

It's also possible to output the report in json using the `-o json` argument for easier machine parsing.

Github has a very low ratelimit for unauthenticated api requests. A "[personal access token][]" can be used to bypass this restriction. Create a GitHub token with "repo" permission and set it to `$GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`. `deisrel` will
use it when making requests.

# Development

The Hephy project welcomes contributions from all developers. The high level process for development matches many other open source projects. See below for an outline.

* Fork this repository
* Make your changes
* [Submit a pull request][prs] (PR) to this repository with your changes, and unit tests whenever possible
	* If your PR fixes any [issues][issues], make sure you write `Fixes #1234` in your PR description (where `#1234` is the number of the issue you're closing)
* The Hephy core contributors will review your code. After each of them sign off on your code, they'll label your PR with `LGTM1` and `LGTM2` (respectively). Once that happens, a contributor will merge it
